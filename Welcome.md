**Hotelier**:

Aimed at those with existing travel related businesses or anyone wishing to begin a travel agency. Hotelier includes custom reservation software in addition to a shopping portal which can be used to offer extra services to your visitors.

The design has full e-commerce functionality with both reservation and deposit paying but can just as easily be used as a simple brochure site if e-commerce is not a requirement.

## Installation ##
