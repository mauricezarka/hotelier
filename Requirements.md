These are the minimum requirements needed before installation of Hotelier or Dvd Retailer can be successful.


**PHP 4.2.x or above - [php.net](http://php.net)**

**MySQL 3.23.x or above - [mysql.org](http://mysql.org)**

**Apache 1.3.x or above - [apache.org](http://httpd.apache.org)**


You must ensure that you have MySQL, XML, and Zlib functionality enabled within your PHP installation.


The remainder of this Manual assumes for the most part, that you have a fully functioning web server.


If installing on your home or office computer (for local testing only) there are a number of packages for the various operating systems that will assist in establishing these requirements.


> XAMPP - multi-platform - Apache, MySQL, PHP, installation. [Xampp](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html) this system should not be used for "live" sites. Check out the XAMPP web site for full details.


> LAMP - Linux platform - Apache, MySQL, PHP, installation. Most Linux distro's now come with a pre-configured LAMP server available for use as a part of the standard installation. Alternatively, this may be available as an add-on, again tailored to your particular flavour of Linux distro, from the project home page. Often the constituent components can be managed separately as well rather than installed as a "unit".


> WAMP - Windows platform - Apache, MySQL, PHP, installation. [Wamp](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)


> MAMP - Macintosh platform - Apache MySQL, PHP, installation. [Mamp](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php)


On remote, hosted or dedicated servers the configuration and availability of these applications will depend on the host provider or the operating system that is installed upon the server. The variation that can occur between providers and OS can be significant and is outside the scope of this brief instruction. If you encounter a problem with your host provider and the use our software! check the forums to see if other users have experienced the particular issue and what their solution was.


Both packages can also be used with alternative web servers such as MicrosoftÂ© Internet Information Service but this is not a path we are exploring in this manual.
